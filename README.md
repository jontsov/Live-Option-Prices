As a user of Trading Work Station by Interactive Brokers, I am currently trying to trade options live. However, for some reason TWS asks me to pay a data subscription to have the data loaded in the TWS application. 
So, I decided to make a WebScrapetr that fetches me the live option prices for the option contract that i am interested in daytrading.

As a user of Trading Work Station by Interactive Brokers, I am currently trying to trade options live. 
However, for some reason TWS asks me to pay a data subscription to have the data loaded in the TWS application. 
So, I decided to make a WebScraper application that fetches me  live option quotes for the option contract that I am interested in daytrading. 
As of version 2 from 14.11.2025, the code loads the data for both Puts and Calls
